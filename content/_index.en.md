# About

Our laboratory pursues a comprehensive approach grounded in microscopic theory, integrating numerical analysis with advanced measurement techniques to elucidate and control the thermal and electrical transport properties and other physical characteristics of multiscale structures spanning different length scales. We further harness phenomena that emerge at the nano- to micro-scale to develop new scientific principles from a mechanical-engineering perspective and to create innovative materials and devices that will advance next-generation energy and electronics industries.
