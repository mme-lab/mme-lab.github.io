## Opportunities for Undergraduate and Graduate Students

MME Laboratory (Shiga Lab) was launched in September 2025.
Through an integrated approach that combines computational modeling and experimental measurement, we seek to understand and control transport phenomena and physical properties across multiple length scales—from low-dimensional materials to hierarchical, multiscale structures. From the perspective of mechanical engineering, we aim at the creation of new scientific principles and the realization of innovative materials and devices.

Our core theme is heat transport mediated by phonons—the quanta of lattice vibrations. At the same time, we also study other carriers that enable broader control of material properties, such as electrons and spin waves.

We welcome highly motivated students who are eager to help build a vibrant laboratory together with our faculty and staff. We are actively recruiting Master’s and Doctoral students, both from within and outside the university; applications from other universities and international students are especially encouraged.
If you are interested, please feel free to contact us via the form below and join us in creating new, yet-unseen value through research.

## Opportunities for Posdoc

Our laboratory aims to pioneer innovative thermal management technologies that will underpin next-generation energy, electronics, and mobility industries. We study nanotubes and two-dimensional materials, their multiscale hybrid architectures, and interfacial/surface phenomena. Centering on phonon-mediated heat transport at the nano–micro scales, we advance both computational modeling and thermal metrology. Beyond phonons, we also explore transport by electrons and spins, broadly pursuing materials property control from a mechanical engineering perspective.

We welcome candidates in both theory/computation and experiment.

- Theory & Computation: Experience with first-principles calculations (e.g., DFT), molecular dynamics, lattice dynamics, and/or finite-element modeling for macro-scale heat transport.
- Experiment: Experience with thermal property measurements such as time-domain/frequency-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR/FDTR) and the 3-omega method.

Background in thermal transport analysis/measurement is preferred but not required. We welcome researchers who can synergize with our strengths and create new value.

We actively support applications to external fellowships, including the [Postdoctoral Fellowships for Research in Japan](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-fellow/index.html).
